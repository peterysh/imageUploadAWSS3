This project shows how to upload files in aws s3.

Also there is some service codes for making there file's own name in the bucket.
Cause as U may know, file names should be unique in my directory.
So I making the Service for keep up the unique point. Also my database stores <file Id, user input file name, file's own name>

Thank U.


U just see this project after 2022/12/26.
there has some problem in my git log. So I pushed different toy project on here. HAHA;;
